Improvements to efficiency of sync search. Added new decoder (Jelinek stack-
bucket decoder) which is more efficient than Fano decoder. Modified code to
improve the effectiveness of -O3 -ffast-math optimization.

Many changes and bug fixes to k9an-wsprd. Also added new two-pass decoding 
mode which can increase the number of spots on a crowded band by as much 
as 30%. 

Also added new wsprsim program which encodes a message that is supplied
on the command line and prints out the channel symbols.

Moved all callsign unpacking into a function. Added some sanity checks
on decoded power and grid.

5-23-2015

Merged in K1JT's changes, including the new -a option to move output files.
Speed up sync_and_demodulation function by calculating sin/cos tables only
when necessary.
Improved metric table calculation, and added -z option to allow variable
metric table bias. This gives us a single "knob" which can be tuned to 
trade off probability of timeout (erasures) vs probability of bit errors.
-z 0.5 corresponds to the "standard" bias, equal to the code rate. Smaller
bias values result in higher path metrics,  making it more likely that 
the Fano algorithm will make it to the final node within the allowed 
number of cycles, but also increasing the probability that the final 
result will contain an error...

The decoder now works with wspr-15 files. It will automatically detect the
mode for a .c2 file. The -m option (no argument) must be used to decode
a wspr-15 .wav file.

Also added "slow" mode (-s option). Currently, it is 20000 cycles and ii=1

5-8-2015 Joe Taylor, K1JT and Steve Franke, K9AN

Merged in Joe Taylor's modifications which yield a huge speed improvement
and also increase # of decodes by 2-3%. Speed improvement ranges from a
factor of 4 to a factor of 8 depending on noise type, with the larger 
improvements associated with files that contain significant lightning events.

Fixed a problem that affected extended callsigns with a 2-character suffix.

Fixed a bug that caused slight frequency error (less than 0.5 Hz). Thanks
to Glenn, N6GN for pointing me toward this issue.

Also added one more digit of precision to frequency reports in ALL_WSPR.TXT.
This will be used to study the variability of frequency estimates.

Applied grid6 patch contributed by John, KD6EKQ. This fixes a bug that
caused the displayed 6-digit locator to be corrupted when there were two
or more type 3 messages decoded.

Applied patch file contributed by John, KD6EKQ. This adds the following:

* Added the ability to read and incorporate fftw wisdom to speed up the
DFT transforms when using PCM WAV input files. The code checks for the
"WSPRD_FFTW_WISDOM" environment variable. If set, it specifies the
file with fftw wisdom.

* Relaxed the error checks on PCM WAV input files to allow 24, 32 bit and
float sample formats (libsndfile handles the details of the conversion,
so there is no real reason to exclude such files).

* Added the -e command line option. It enables code that corrects for
transceiver tuning error. The argument is the dial freq error in Hz.
